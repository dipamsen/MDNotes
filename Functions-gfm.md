# Relations and Functions

## Relations

-   Relations are a subset of the **cardinal product of two sets.**

A relation between set *A* and *B* can be denoted as:
*R*<sub>*A**B*</sub> ⊆ {(*x*,*y*) : *x* ∈ *A*, *y* ∈ *B*}

## Functions

-   Functions are Relations of whom:

    -   Every element of first set should have an image in second set.
    -   No *x* ∈ *A* can have more than one image in *B*

## Types of Relations

1.  Void Relation

Let *A* be a set. Then *ϕ* ⊆ *A* × *A* , so it is a relation on *A*.

2.  Universal Relation

Let *A* be a set. Then *A* × *A* ⊆ *A* × *A*

3.  Identity Relation

Let *A* be a set. Then the Relation
*I*<sub>*A*</sub> = {(*a*,*a*) : *a* ∈ *A*}

4.  Reflexive Relation

A relation *R* on a set *A* is said to be reflexive if every element of
*A* is related to itself. The R is reflexive  ⇔ (*a*,*a*) ∈ *R* for all
*a* ∈ *A*

> Eg:
> *A* = {1, 2, 3}
>
> *R*<sub>1</sub> = {(1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (1,3), (1,2)}
>
> *R*<sub>1</sub> is reflexive.
>
> *R*<sub>2</sub> = {(1,1), (2,2)}
>
> *R*<sub>2</sub> is not reflexive.

-   Symmetric Relations

A relation *R* on a set *A* is symmetric iff:
(*a*,*b*) ∈ *R* ⟹ (*b*,*a*) ∈ *R*
for all *a*, *b* ∈ *A*

-   Transitive Relations

A relation *R* on a set *A* is transitive iff:
(*a*,*b*) ∈ *R*  ∧ (*b*,*c*) ∈ *R* ⟹ (*a*,*c*) ∈ *R*
for all *a*, *b*, *c* ∈ *A*

Notes:

-   *R*<sub>1</sub> is Symmetric and Transitive  ⟹ *R*<sub>1</sub> is
    Reflexive.

-   Equivalence relation:

Iff:

-   it is reflexive ((*a*,*a*) is present for all *a*)
-   it is symmetric ((*a*,*b*) implies (*b*,*a*))
-   it is transitive ((*a*,*b*) and (*b*,*c*) implies (*a*,*c*))
