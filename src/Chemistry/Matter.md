# **Matter, Atoms and Molecules**

> **Topics:** Matter and its nature; Dalton's atomic theory; Concept of atom, molecule, element, and compound

As we know, **anything which occupies space and has mass is called matter.**

- All matter is made up of atoms.

## States of Matter

|**State**|**Definite Volume**|**Definite Shape**|
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
|**Solid**|Yes|Yes|
|**Liquid**|Yes|No|
|**Gas**|No|No|


$$\ce{Solid <=>[heat][cool] Liquid <=>[heat][cool] Gas}$$

## Classification of Matter

### Element

An **Element** is a pure substance which is made up of only one type of atom. It cannot be decomposed or built from simpler substances. \
*Eg: Gold, Hydrogen*

- Metals are further classified as Metals, Non Metals and Metalloids.

### Compound

A **Compound** is obtained by the reaction of two or more elements in a fixed mass ratio.

- The property of the compound does not depend on its constituent elements. 
- Its constituent elements cannot be extracted by physical means.  \
  *Eg: Water, Carbon Dioxide*


**Types of Compounds:**

- **Organic Compounds:** These compounds are obtained from living sources such as plants and animals. All these compounds contain carbon.
- **Inorganic Compounds:** These compounds are obtained fom non-living sources such as rocks and minerals.


### Mixture

A **Mixture** is the product obtainend by mixing two or more substances. 

- The proportion is not fixed and the properties of constituent substances are retained. 
- Physical methods can be used to extract the constituents. 
- Mixtures can be homogenous or heterogenous. \
  *Eg: Air, Tea, Sugar Solution*

**Types of Mixtures:**

- A mixture is said to be **homogeneous** if it has an uniform composition throughout. (Air)
- A mixture is said to be **heterogeneous** if its composition is not unique throughout. (Mixture of Iron fillings and Sulphur)

## Atoms and Molecules

An atom is the smallest unit of matter. Molecules are made up of atoms.

- All substances are made up of molecules. \
  _Eg: Hydrogen Molecule ($\ce{H2}$), Water Molecule ($\ce{H2O}$), etc._

## Dalton's Atomic Theory

John Dalton proposed the first Atomic Theory in 1808.

- Matter consists of indivisible atoms.
- All atoms of a given element have identical properties, including mass. Atoms of different elements differ in mass.
- Compounds are formed by the combination of different elements in a fixed ratio.
- Atoms are neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. Chemical reactions involve reorganisation of atoms.
