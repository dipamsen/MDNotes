# **Chemical Measurements**

> **Topics:** Physical quantities and their measurements in Chemistry; Precision and Accuracy; Significant Figures; SI Units; Dimensional Analysis

## Properties of Matter

All substances have various characteristic properties. These properties can be physical or chemical.

**Physical properties** can be measured/observed without changing the identity of a substance. (_Eg: Color, Mass, Melting and Boiling Point_)

On the other hand, the measurement of **Chemical properties** require the occurence of a chemical change. (_Eg: Acidity, Basicity, Combustibility_)

## Measuring Physical Properties

Physical properties such as mass, length, volume, etc. are quantitative in nature, and are expressed by a number followed by units.

$$\pu{47km}$$

## SI Units
By convention, scientists use the **SI System of Units** as a standard for measurement of various physical properties.

In the SI system, units for **seven** base quantities are defined. (See Figure 1.) All the other quantities can be derived by from the base quantities.

> **Derived Units**
> 
> SI Units for quantities such as speed, force, energy can be derived from the seven base units.
> $$\pu{Speed: m s-1}$$
> $$\pu{Force: kg m s-2}$$
> $$\pu{Energy: kg m2 s-2}$$

### Common prefixes

These prefixes are used with the SI units to express a large or small quantities.

|**Multiple**|**Prefix**|**Symbol**|
|:----:|:----:|:----:|
|$10^{-15}$|femto|$\pu{f}$|
|$10^{-12}$|pico|$\pu{p}$|
|$10^{-9}$|nano|$\pu{n}$|
|$10^{-6}$|micro|$\pu{\mu}$|
|$10^{-3}$|milli|$\pu{m}$|
|$10^{3}$|kilo|$\pu{k}$|
|$10^{6}$|mega|$\pu{M}$|
|$10^{9}$|giga|$\pu{G}$|
|$10^{12}$|tera|$\pu{T}$|
