# Acids, Bases and Salts

## Acids

Acids furnish $\ce{H+}$ ions or $\ce{H3O+}$ ions when dissolved in water. Acids have one or more replaceable $\ce{H}$ atoms

Acid is capable of producing hydrogen ion $\ce{H+}$ by dissociating in aqueous solution. This reaction can be represented by

$$\ce{\ud{HA(aq)}{Acid} -> \ud{H+(aq)}{Hydrogen Ion (proton)} \ud{A-(aq)}{}}$$

For example: Hydrochloric Acid $(\ce{HCl})$
$$\ce{HCl(aq)-> H+(aq) Cl-(aq)}$$

The proton or hydrogen ion binds itself to a water molecule to form a **hydronium ion** $\ce{(H3O+)}$

$$\ce{\ud{H+}{Hydrogen Ion (proton)} + \ud{H2O}{Water} -> \ud{H3O+}{Hydronium Ion}}$$

The **hydronium ion** is also known as **oxonium ion** or **hydroxonium ion**.

The first equation can be rewritten as

$$\ce{HA(aq) + H2O -> H3O+(aq) A-(aq)}$$

> **Note**: $\ce{H+}$ ions are protons.

- Acids generally have sour taste.
- Acids change Blue litmus Red.
- They are colorless with **phenolphthalein** and pink with **methyl orange**.
- Acids show acidic nature in their aqueous form.

### Classification of Acids

- **Based on Source:**

  - **Organic Acids** are present in plants and animals (living beings).
    Eg: $\ce{HCOOH}$ (Formic Acid), $\ce{CH3COOH}$ (Acetic Acid)

  - **Inorganic Acids** are found from rocks and minerals.
    Eg: $\ce{HCl}$ (Hydrochloric Acid), $\ce{HNO3}$ (Nitric Acid), $\ce{H2SO4}$ (Sulphuric Acid)

- **Based on their Basicity**
  Basicity = The number of $\ce{H}$ atoms replaceable by a base in a particular acid.

  - **Monabasic Acid** gives one $\ce{H}+$ ion per molecule of the acid in solution.
    Eg: $\ce{HCl}$, $\ce{HNO3}$

  - **Dibasic Acid** gives two $\ce{H+}$ ions per molecule of the acid in the solution.
    Eg: $\ce{H2SO4}$, $\ce{H2CO3}$

  - **Tribasic Acid** gives three $\ce{H+}$ ions per molecule of the acid in the solution.
    Eg: $\ce{H3PO4}$

* **Based on Ionisation**

  - **Strong Acids** ionise completely in water.
    Eg: $\ce{HCl}$

  - **Weak Acids** ionise partially in water.
    Eg: $\ce{CH3COOH}$

* **Based on Concentration**
  - **Concentrated Acid** has a relatively high percentage of acid in its aqueous solution.
  - **Dilute Acid** has a relatively low percentage of acid in its aqueous solution.
