# Acids, Bases and Salts

## Acids

Acids furnish $\ce{H+}$ ions or $\ce{H3O+}$ ions when dissolved in water. Acids have one or more replaceable $\ce{H}$ atoms.

**Arrhenius Concept of Acids**

</summary>

Acid is capable of producing hydrogen ion $\ce{H+}$ by dissociating in aqueous solution. This reaction can be represented by

$$\ce{HA(aq) -> H+(aq) A-(aq)}$$

For example: Hydrochloric Acid $(\ce{HCl})$

$$\ce{HCl(aq) -> H+(aq) Cl-(aq)}$$

The proton or hydrogen ion binds itself to a water molecule to form a **hydronium ion** $\ce{(H3O+)}$

$$\ce{\ud{H+}{Hydrogen Ion} + \ud{H2O}{Water} -> \ud{H3O+}{Hydronium Ion}}$$

The **hydronium ion** is also known as **oxonium ion** or **hydroxonium ion**.

### Properties of Acids

- Acids generally have sour taste.
- Acids change Blue litmus Red.
- They are colorless with **phenolphthalein** and pink with **methyl orange**.
- Acids show acidic nature in their aqueous form.

### Classification of Acids

- **Based on Source:**

  - **Organic Acids** are present in plants and animals (living beings).

    Eg:

    - $\ce{HCOOH}$ (Formic Acid/Methanoic Acid, found in **stings of bees/ants**)
    - $\ce{CH3COOH}$ (Acetic Acid/Ethanoic Acid, found in **Vinegar**)

  - **Inorganic Acids** are found from rocks and minerals.

    Eg: $\ce{HCl}$ (Hydrochloric Acid), $\ce{HNO3}$ (Nitric Acid), $\ce{H2SO4}$ (Sulphuric Acid)

- **Based on their Basicity**

  Basicity = The number of $\ce{H}$ atoms replaceable by a base in a particular acid.

  - **Monabasic Acid** gives one $\ce{H+}$ ion per molecule of the acid in solution.

    Eg: $\ce{HCl}$, $\ce{HNO3}$

  - **Dibasic Acid** gives two $\ce{H+}$ ions per molecule of the acid in the solution.

    Eg: $\ce{H2SO4}$, $\ce{H2CO3}$

  - **Tribasic Acid** gives three $\ce{H+}$ ions per molecule of the acid in the solution.

    Eg: $\ce{H3PO4}$

* **Based on Ionisation**

  - **Strong Acids** ionise completely in water.

    Eg: $\ce{HCl}$

  - **Weak Acids** ionise partially in water.

    Eg: $\ce{CH3COOH}$

* **Based on Concentration**
  - **Concentrated Acid** has a relatively high percentage of acid in its aqueous solution.
  - **Dilute Acid** has a relatively low percentage of acid in its aqueous solution.

### Chemical Properties of Acids

- **Reaction of acids with Metals**

  Acids give hydrogen gas along with respective salt when they react with a metal.

  $\ce{Metal + Acid -> Salt + Hydrogen}$

  Examples:

  - $\ce{Zn + 2HCl -> ZnCl2 + H2 ^}$
  - $\ce{2Na + 2HCl -> 2NaCl2 + H2 ^}$
  - $\ce{Fe + 2HCl -> FeCl2 + H2 ^}$
  - $\ce{Zn + H2SO4 -> ZnSO4 + H2 ^}$

- **Reaction of acids with Metal Carbonates**

  Acids react with metal carbonates to give respective salt, carbon dioxide and water.

  $\ce{Metal Carbonate + Acid -> Salt + Carbon Dioxide + Water}$

  Examples:

  - $\ce{CaCO3 + H2SO4 -> CaSO4 + H2O + CO2 ^}$
  - $\ce{Na2CO3 + H2SO4 -> Na2SO4 + H2O + CO2 ^}$
  - $\ce{CaCO3 + 2HCl -> CaCl2 + H2O + CO2 ^}$
  - $\ce{Na2CO3 + 2HCl -> 2NaCl + H2O + CO2 ^}$
  - $\ce{MgCO3 + 2HCl -> MgCl2 + H2O + CO2 ^}$
  - $\ce{Na2CO3 + 2HNO3 -> NaNO3 + H2O + CO2 ^}$

* **Reaction of acids with Metal Hydrogen Carbonates (Bicarbonates)**

  Acids give $\ce{CO2}$ gas, respective salt and water when they react with metal hydrogen carbonates.

  $\ce{Metal Bicarbonate + Acid -> Salt + Water + Carbon Dioxide}$

  Examples:

  - $\ce{NaHCO3 + HCl -> NaCl + H2O + CO2 ^}$
  - $\ce{2NaHCO3 + H2SO4 -> Na2SO4 + 2H2O + 2CO2 ^}$

> **Notes:**
>
> - Sodium Bicarbonate $(\ce{NaHCO3})$ is also known as Sodium Hydrogen Carbonate, **Baking Soda** and **Baking Powder**
> - The gas evolved in the reaction of acid and metal hydrogen carbonate or bicarbonate, **turns lime water milky**. This indicates that the gas is Carbon Dioxide $(\ce{CO2})$.
>
>   This is due to the formation of white ppt of **Calcium Carbonate**, $\ce{CaCO3}$
>
> $$\ud{CaOH2 + CO2 -> H2O + CaCO3 v}{Carbon Dioxide turns lime water milky.}$$
>
> - But when excess $\ce{CO2}$ is passed through lime water, it makes the milky colour disappear.
>
>   This happens because of formation of **calcium hydrogen carbonate**. As it is soluble in water, the milky colour dissapears.
>
> $$\ud{CaCO3 + H2O + CO2 -> CaHCO3(aq)}{Excess carbon dioxide makes the milky colour disappear.}$$
>
> - **Calcium Carbonate**, $\ce{CaCO3}$ is a salt found in **eggshells**, **chalk powder** and **marble**.

- **Reaction of acids with Metallic oxides**

  Metal oxides are basic in nature. Thus, when an acid reacts with a metal oxide, both neutralize each other. In this reaction, respective salt and water is formed.

  $\ce{Acid + Metal Oxide -> Salt + Water}$

  Examples:

  - $\ce{2HCl + CaO -> CaCl2 + H2O}$
  - $\ce{H2SO4 + ZnO -> ZnSO4 + H2O}$
  - $\ce{6HCl + Al2O3 -> 2AlCl3 + 3H2O}$
